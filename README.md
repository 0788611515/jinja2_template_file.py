# jinja2_template_file.py
You can use any database driver that you are familiar with. Assume the a users table is already defined, something along the lines of: USERID INTEGER Not Null NAME VARCHAR(30) Not Null EMAIL VARCHAR(50) Not Null LOGINID VARCHAR(15) Not Null PASSWD VARCHAR(15) Not Null USERTYPE SMALLINT Not Null Write a jinja2 template file that generates an HTML input form that will allow the user to  update their own profile details. It must display their current record, and allow them to modify just their: name email and/or update their password The current password is encrypted so it will be the only field that you will not be able to display  the current value.. but if something is returned then you will crypt that and save it Set the form’s action to “app.cgi?viewid=1000&amp;mode=1” and the method = POST Then write a python module called profile.py, with the following inputs to render this jinja2  template. Userid (integer) Mode (integer) based on the MODE, it will either fetch the current user’s record from the database, or update  the current user’s record with the supplied inputs from the form. Your python module needs to supply valid HTML output.
